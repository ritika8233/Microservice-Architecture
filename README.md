# Microservice-Architecture

This source was developed for Java based microservice architecture.

#Microservices: 
*It is an architecture based on which large applications are built as a collection of small functional modules.
*These functional modules are independently deployable, scalable, target specific business goals, and communicate with each other over standard protocols.
*Modules can also be implemented using different programming languages, have their databases, and deployed on different software environments.
